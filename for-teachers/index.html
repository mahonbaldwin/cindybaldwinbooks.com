<p>I love connecting with readers through visits to schools and book clubs! I’m currently offering both virtual and in-person visits. To contact me about scheduling a visit, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:cindybaldwinbooks@gmail.com">cindybaldwinbooks@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Free classroom visit—30-minute reading and Q&amp;A:</strong> I offer free 30-minute virtual visits on the video conferencing platform of your choice! During these visits I’ll share briefly about myself, read a selection from my latest book, and answer questions from your students. I offer these visits for in-person, distance learning, or hybrid classes. Please have your students prepare questions in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Free book club visit—30-minute reading and Q&amp;A:</strong> I offer free 30-minute virtual visits for book clubs (children or adults!) who have read one of my books. During these visits I’ll introduce myself, read a selection from my latest book, and answer questions from book club members. These can be done on the video conferencing platform of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Author presentation: “Struggles Into Superpowers&quot;:</strong> (40-60 minutes) In this engaging author talk, I’ll share how growing up with cystic fibrosis influenced my author journey, teaching me resilience and the true power of books. Through the story of how I became an author, I’ll show how the hardest things in our lives can sometimes lead us to our strongest superpowers.</p>
<p><strong>“Writing Workshop: “Three-Part Storytelling”:</strong> (30-60 minutes, depending on age) In this interactive workshop, I’ll teach students how to use the three parts of a story (beginning, middle, and end) to create strong, exciting stories of their own—based on the same three-act structure that grown-up authors study! After I’ve shared the secret things every beginning, middle, and end need, the kids and I will work together to put the principles into practice and build a collaborative story. For younger students, I’ll share a printable template for students to use in writing their own three-part stories later (Suitable for grades K-3). For older students and longer class times, I’ll allot part of the workshop for students to begin their own three-part stories, including a few minutes at the end for any students who wish to share what they’ve written (suitable for grades 5-8).</p>
<p>Pricing:</p>
<p>$250 for a single class period</p>
<p>$500 for a half day</p>
<p>$1,000 for a full day</p>
<p>(Plus travel costs if the school is more than an hour away.)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re teaching in a Title 1 school or need help with ideas to secure funding for an author visit, please let me know!</p>

Cindy Baldwin’s presentation for our 4th and 5th graders was a tremendous example of
“triumph through adversity”, as she shared with us about her own personal health
experiences and the journey of being a writer. Many of our students related to her
statement that “not all stories have a happy ending”. Throughout Cindy’s time with us,
we were able to make connections to the characters in her books&ndash;of relationship and
family struggles, loss and yet learning to become a better person. I would highly
recommend an author visit with Cindy Baldwin! — Heidi Mozelewski, Bellingham, WA</p>
<p>Loved meeting author Cindy Baldwin! Her presentation focused on the theme of resilience
and I could tell it resonated with students. — Danae Powers, Seattle, WA</p>
